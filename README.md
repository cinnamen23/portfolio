### Work Experience
Software developer @ Beauty4u HQ
- Transformed regular sales data into visual representations, structured the data, generated reports to aid decision-making, and conducted ad-hoc analysis to support specific business requirements and orders using Excel skills.
- At the on-premises Point of Sale system, feasibility studies were conducted, and a thorough analysis of the program architecture and data flow. A design for the ordering and receiving segment of the system was revamped using MS SQL and C# for problem-solving. This led to a reduction of over 85% in average processing time and the implementation of automated systems.

### Projects
## Classifying befitting faculty and research experts on a project topic
- Developed a comprehensive data collection approach by data mapping from various sources, including web scraping, APIs, databases, and spreadsheets. Leveraged Azure Data Factory to create an ETL pipeline that regularly gathers data from various sources for faculty and research expert profiles. Improved accessibility by transitioning the on-premises Neo4j database to the cloud using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), leading to a 99.9% increase in data accessibility and data usability.
- Built user interface for retrieval and achieved a 40% surge in the retrieval process efficiency by applying cosine similarity and graph embedding algorithms to delineate user groups and potential interest categories.
## Concept drift detection using ensemble technique in a time series data	
-	Utilized Azure Databricks for scalable data processing and analysis of time series data and implemented an ensemble model with concept drift detection methods (ADWIN, KSWIN, and Page-Hinkley), achieving a 27% reduction in Mean Squared Error, leading to enhanced predictive accuracy and more reliable outcomes. The model was validated using K-fold cross-validation.
## Detecting Fake News Over Social Media and News Articles Using NLP and Machine Learning
-	Employing Natural Language Processing Techniques Utilizing n-gram analysis and TF-IDF to language patterns and extract features from news articles and social media post datasets.
-	Utilizing Machine Learning Algorithms/Models, Logistic Regression, and Linear SVM as classifiers to distinguish between real and fake news based on the extracted features. Tuning models across the model's parameters and Implementing methods improved the accuracy of the previous work on our dataset by about 7%.
## Analyzing rent cost trends post-COVID-19 in the U.S. using R and ggplot2	
-	Through the application of statistical techniques, the critical elements influencing the notable oscillations in rental costs during the post-COVID-19 period were pinpointed. This endeavor led to a 40% decrease in the overall intricacy of the model, consequently amplifying both its efficiency and comprehensibility.
-	Conducting data profiling and manipulation in R, coupled with creating informative visualizations using ggplot2, implemented impact analysis for the identification of the primary impact variables. Employing the Random Forest model led to the creation of a predictive model, achieving an 85% accuracy in foreseeing fluctuations in rental costs.
